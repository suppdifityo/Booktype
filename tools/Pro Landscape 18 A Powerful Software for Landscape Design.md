## Photo Imaging
 
One of the most popular features of Pro Landscape 18 is its photo imaging tool. This tool allows you to take a picture of your client's property and then add plants, hardscapes, water features, and other elements to create a realistic design. You can choose from over 10,000 items in the imaging database[^1^], or import your own images. You can also edit the colors, sizes, shadows, and perspectives of the objects to make them fit perfectly into the scene. You can even create before-and-after pictures to show your client the difference your design will make.
 
## CAD
 
Another feature of Pro Landscape 18 is its CAD tool. This tool allows you to create detailed and accurate drawings of your design using industry-standard symbols and dimensions. You can draw in 2D or 3D, and use layers, snaps, and grids to make your work easier. You can also import DWG files from other CAD programs or export your drawings to PDF or DXF formats. Pro Landscape 18 also has a paver tool that lets you create custom paver patterns and layouts[^2^]. You can also add irrigation plans with automatic sprinkler layout tools[^1^].
 
## Lighting
 
Pro Landscape 18 also has a lighting tool that lets you add night and holiday lighting effects to your design. You can choose from different types of lights, such as spotlights, path lights, string lights, and more. You can also adjust the brightness, color, direction, and angle of the lights to create the desired mood. You can then show your client how their property will look at night or during different seasons and holidays.
 
## Proposals
 
The final feature of Pro Landscape 18 is its proposal tool. This tool allows you to create professional quotes for your clients based on your design. You can enter the quantities and prices of the materials and labor you will need, and Pro Landscape 18 will automatically calculate the total cost and profit. You can also add taxes, discounts, terms and conditions, and other information to your proposal. You can then print or email your proposal to your client along with your design images and drawings.
 
## Companion App
 
Pro Landscape 18 also has a companion app for iPad and Android tablets that lets you create, edit, and present your designs right on site[^3^]. You can use the app to take pictures of your client's property, add design elements, show different options, and get feedback. You can also sync your designs with your computer and access them from anywhere.
